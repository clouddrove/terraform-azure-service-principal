We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-service-principal/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### with password
```hcl
  module "service-principal" {
  source                         = "clouddrove/service-principal/azure"

  name                           = "app"
  environment                    = "test"
  label_order                    = ["name", "environment"]
  password_rotation_in_years     = 1
  end_date                       = "2024-05-01T01:02:03Z"
  # Adding roles and scope to service principal
  assignments = [
    {
      scope                = "/subscriptions/068245XXXXXXXXXXe1cabc60c"
      role_definition_name = "owner"
    },
  ]
}
```
  ### with certificate
```hcl
  module "virtual-machine" {
  source                               = "clouddrove/service-principal/azure"

| client\_secret | Password for service principal. |
| service\_principal\_application\_id | The object id of service principal. Can be used to assign roles to user. |

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
